			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>Praveen de Silva and Thilina Fernando established CoursX in 2012 with the goal of offering life-changing learning experiences to learners all around the world. CoursX is now a worldwide online learning platform that provides anybody, anywhere with access to online courses and degrees from top institutions and businesses.

			<h3>We believe</h3>
			<p>Human growth is based on learning. It has the ability to change our world from sickness to health, from poverty to riches, and from war to peace. It has the potential to change our lives, our families' lives, and our communities' lives. Learning allows us to adapt, develop, and redefine what is possible, regardless of who we are or where we are. As a result, having access to the highest education is a right, not a privilege. That is why CoursX exists. We collaborate with the top universities to deliver the best education to people all around the world. So that anybody, wherever, has the ability to change their lives via education.</p>
